//1
runtime environment to run JS outside browser in the backend
is a library with built-in modules
runs on google's v8 engine so ultra fast
allows for frontend+backend development in JS

//2
function without name called anonymous function eg- function(){}
callback function concept

//3
global objects- __filename absolute path to file being executed
                __dirname absolute path to directory of file being executed

global functions- setTimeout(function, timeinms).. function executed after timeinms seconds
                  setInterval(function, timeinms).. function executed after every timeinms seconds

//4
asynchronous feature ie callbacks concept

//5
modules contain related code

//6
core modules ie built in modules
http module.. used to create server

//7
one reason nodejs is fast is because it's coded around events
events and event handlers

//8
fs(filesystem) module
every function in fs module has synchronous and asynchronous form

synchronous form blocks execution
asynchronous form doesn't, instead when data is ready calls callback function

//9
streams are UNIX pipes that reads data from a source and pipes that data to a destination
two types- readable and writeable streams
streams used because reading,writing data happen in chunks

//10
piping concept
data 'piped' from source to destination
